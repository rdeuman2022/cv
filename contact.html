    <p>
      Since I was born in a small village named Bakrah situated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Development_Region,_Nepal"><em>Eastern Nepal</em></a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koshi_Zone"><strong><em>Koshi Zone</em></strong></a> ,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morang_District"><strong><em>Morang District</em></strong></a> , I started my school life there until I passed class two.
      Then we whole family came to Kathmandu and lived here since BS 2058. Here, I joined class three in Shree Janauddhar Secondary School and passed my matriculation
      examination from there with 75% marks. Then we were living in Sitapaila, Kathmandu. There I made few good friends and then I joined Kathamndu Valley college in Chhauni, Kathmandu for my higher secondary level education.
      After passing plus two with 69.67% from KVC, I took preparation class for BE in <a href="http://pea.edu.np/"><strong><em>PEA</em></strong></a> setting goal of Pulchowk Campus for BE. Sadly I could not make it to the <a href="https://pcampus.edu.np/"> <strong> <em>Pulchowk Campus </em></strong></a>that year so I tried again next year but this year
      a massive earthquake hit Nepal and could not yet again make it to Pulchowk and so I decided to study in Kantipur Engineering College for BE. There I finished my bachelor degree and then I was just getting ready for US so I was taking GRE
      preparation classes. But sadly, a deadly dangerous virus, CORONA, outbreak took place and every country aroud the world were forced to lockdown and everything was closed down including Nepal.
      With all the classes being shut everyone were forced to stay inside and stay away from the others.
